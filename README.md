## Features

- **Fully Responsive:** Adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach.
- **Modern Design:** Clean, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing user interface.
- **Single File:** Easy to deploy and manage, as the entire application resides within one `index.html` file.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utilizes a highly efficient and customizable CSS framework for styling.
- **Interactive Mobile Menu:** A simple JavaScript toggle for navigation on smaller devices.

## Getting Started

To get started with this application, simply download or copy the `index.html` file.

1.  **Save the file:** Save the content of `index.html` to a file named `index.html` in your desired directory.
2.  **Open in Browser:** Open the `index.html` file directly in any modern web browser.

No complex build steps or dependencies are required, thanks to the use of Tailwind CSS via CDN.

## Project Structure

This project is intentionally minimalist, consisting of primarily three files:
- `index.html`: The core responsive web application.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5:** For the core structure of the web page.
